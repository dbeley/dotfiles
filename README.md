# Software

Some config files might need my own [scripts](https://github.com/dbeley/scripts) repo in the home directory.

To create symbolic links:
```
git clone https://github.com/dbeley/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
stow nvim sway bash_wayland
```

## WMs

* Hyprland (with waybar): Extensive configuration.
* sway (with waybar): Extensive configuration without XWayland. Mostly the same as i3 configuration.
* i3/i3-gaps (with polybar): Extensive configuration. Several modes for gaps presets or resizing/moving containers.
* dwm: Extensive configuration (available on my [fork](https://github.com/dbeley/dwm)).
* xmonad (with xmobar): Extensive configuration. Named scratchpads, several layouts.
* bspwm (with polybar): Simple configuration.
* exwm: Simple configuration.

## Editors

* doom-emacs: Main editor.
* neovim (with vim-plug): Extensive configuration, mainly for python and go.
* vim: Very simple configuration.
* ideavim
* emacs (deprecated): Extensive configuration, including exwm (needs to uncomment stuff).

## Web Browsers

## Utilities

## Others

The following config folders need to have a different root than `~`. You can create symbolic links to a specific folder with the `stow -t` command.
* NetworkManager: `stow -t /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/ NetworkManager`
* dracut: `stow -t /etc/dracut.conf.d/ dracut`
* xorg: `stow -t /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/ xorg`
* collatz: `stow -t /var/lib/boinc/projects/boinc.thesonntags.com_collatz/ collatz`
* reflector: `stow -t /etc/xdg/reflector/ reflector`
